# Firebase Transaction Race Condition: Inaccurate Counter Updates

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Firebase transactions to update counters concurrently.  The problem stems from potential race conditions that can lead to inaccurate counter updates. 

## Problem Description
The provided JavaScript code uses a Firebase transaction to increment a counter. However, if multiple clients attempt to increment the counter simultaneously, there's a chance that increments will be lost or the counter's value will not reflect the actual number of increments.

## Solution
The solution involves using a more robust approach to ensure atomic operations and prevent race conditions. This can be achieved by modifying the transaction logic or employing alternative strategies such as using Firestore's atomic increment operation. 

## How to reproduce the error
1.  Set up a Firebase project.
2.  Run the `bug.js` code to observe the counter's behavior under concurrent access.  You'll likely notice that the counter's value doesn't always accurately reflect the number of increment attempts.

## How to test the solution
1.  Replace the `bug.js` file with `bugSolution.js`.
2.  Run the updated code to verify that the race condition is resolved and the counter accurately reflects the number of increments, even with multiple concurrent access.
